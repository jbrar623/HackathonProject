                <h3>What is Naloxone?</h3>
                <p>
                    Naloxone is a medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) designed to rapidly reverse opioid overdose. It is an opioid antagonistâ€”meaning that it binds to opioid receptors and can reverse and block the effects of other opioids, such as heroin, morphine, and oxycodone. Administered when a patient is showing signs of opioid overdose, naloxone is a temporary treatment and its effects do not last long. Therefore, it is critical to obtain medical intervention as soon as possible after administering/receiving naloxone.

            <h2>Types of Opiods:</h2>
                <p>
                    Some opioid drugs are made from naturally occurring plant compounds (alkaloids) that come from a specific type of poppy plant called an opium poppy.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Other opioid drugs are synthetic, meaning they are human-made substances created in a laboratory. Or, an opioid drug may contain both naturally derived and synthetic ingredients, including other drugs.
